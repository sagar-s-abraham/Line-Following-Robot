# Line-Following-Robot
A robot created for the RoboRave competition held at Choice School, Ernakulam.  
The objective of the competition was very simple. Create a robot which can successfully navigate via a course having black lines and deliver small balls at the finish line. The robot can only be touched by the participants until it reaches the start line by retracing its path again. Most number of balls delivered under a time limit wins!  
So, this was a simple robot created by me and my teammate-Amar.  
This robot consists of 2 IR Sensors at the front-bottom part of the robot so as to read the lines/track to follow.  
At the end of the track, there will be a goal with a sturdy casing. So, we used a pressure switch which hits the goal and activates the delivery system.  
The delivery system consists of a small motor to open the hatch of the delivery system, another motor with a spoke wheel to disturb the quietly sitting balls and have them pass through the hatch when the robot reaches the goal, and an UltraSonic Sensor to detect when the box is empty.  
So. I'll be adding an Arduino code file with the program.  
Enjoy!
